# Examples

This is the examples directory accompanying the pypahdb Python package
and can be used to verify correct installation of the package and as a
templete for using pypahdb in your own code.

The example.py-file can be directly run from the terminal:

```./example.py```

Currently two example input-files are provided. The first is a
FITS-file containing a Spitzer-IRS data cube of the northwest PDR in
NGC 7023. The second is an ASCII-tabulated spectrum from a single
position in the NGC 7023 data cube.

Upon successfully running the example program, two files should have
appeared. One is a PDF-file summarizing the results, the other is a
FITS-file with the ionized fraction, large fraction and norm.
