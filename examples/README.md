# Examples

This is the examples directory accompanying the pypahdb Python package
and can be used to verify correct installation of the package and as a
templete for using pypahdb in your own code.

The example.py-file can be directly run from the terminal:

```./example.py```

Or via:

```python example.py```

By default, it uses a sample ASCII-tabulated spectrum from a single
position in the NGC 7023 data cube (stored within the pypahdb/data folder).

Upon successfully running the example program, two files should have
appeared. One is a PDF-file summarizing the results, the other is a
FITS-file with the ionized fraction, large fraction and norm.
