Design
============

Pypahdb analyzes spectroscopic observations (including spectral maps)
and characterizes the PAH emission in terms of PAH ionization and size
fractions using a database-fitting approach.

The pypahdb package is imported with the following statement:

.. code-block:: python

    import pypahdb

Flowchart
-----------------

.. figure:: figures/fig_flowchart.png
   :align: center

   Pypahdb flowchart. (1) Astronomical spectroscopic data is loaded from 
   FITS or ASCII files. (2) A highly over-sampled pre-computed matrix of
   PAH spectra is loaded and interpolated onto the wavelength grid of the
   astronomical observations. Database-fitting is performed using a 
   non-negative least-squares (NNLS) approach, which yields the contribution
   of an individual PAH molecule. As a result, the fit can be broken down in
   terms of PAH charge and size. (3) The results are written to disk as a
   single FITS file and as a PDF summarizing the results (one page per pixel,
   if a spectral cube is provided as input).

The general program methodology is encapsulated in the flowchart
presented in the figure above and is as follows:

(1) Read-in a file containing spectroscopic PAH observations of an
    astronomical object. This functionality is provided by the class
    ``Observation``, which is implemented in ``observation.py``. It is
    the responsibility of the user to ensure all non-PAH emission
    components have been removed from the spectrum. The class uses a
    fall-through try-except chain to attempt to read the given
    filename using the facilities provided by ``astropy.io``. The
    spectroscopic data is stored as a ``specutils.Spectrum1D``
    object. The ``Spectrum1D`` class provides functionality to convert
    between different coordinate representations. Below is example
    Python code demonstrating the use of the class. The file
    ``sample_data_NGC7023.tbl`` in this demonstration is bundled with the
    pypahdb package. The output of the demonstration code is shown in the
    flowchart.

.. code-block:: python

    import pkg_resources

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from pypahdb.observation import Observation

    file_path = 'resources/sample_data_NGC7023.tbl'
    data_file = pkg_resources.resource_filename('pypahdb', file_path)

    obs = Observation(data_file)
    s = obs.spectrum
    plt.plot(s.spectral_axis, s.flux[0,0,:])
    plt.show()

(2) Decompose the observed PAH emission in terms of contributing PAH
    subclasses, here charge and size. This functionality
    is provided by the class ``Decomposer``, which is implemented in
    ``decomposer.py`` and takes ``decomposer_base.py`` as its base.
    The ``Decomposer`` class takes as input a ``Spectrum1D`` object,
    of which it takes a deep copy and calls the
    ``Unit.to`` method on to convert the abscissa units
    to wavenumber. Subsequently, a pre-computed ``numpy`` matrix of
    highly oversampled PAH emission spectra stored as a ``pickle`` is
    loaded from file. Utilizing ``numpy.interp``, each of the PAH
    emission spectra, represented by a single column in the
    pre-computed matrix, is interpolated onto the frequency grid (in
    wavenumber) of the input spectrum. This process is parallelized
    using the ``multiprocessing`` package. ``optimize.nnls`` is used
    to perform a non-negative least-squares (NNLS) fit of the
    interpolated, pre-computed spectra to the input spectra. NNLS is
    chosen because it is appropriate to the problem, fast, and always
    converges. The solution vector (weights) is stored as an attribute
    and considered private to ``Decomposer``. Combining lazy instantiation
    and Python's @property, the fit and the breakdown can be retrieved. When
    the input spectrum represents a spectral cube the calculations are
    parallelized across each pixel using, again, the
    ``multiprocessing`` package. Below is example code demonstrating
    the use of the ``Decomposer`` and extends the previous code-block. The
    output from the code-block is shown in the flowchart.

.. code-block:: python

    from pypahdb.decomposer import Decomposer

    result = Decomposer(obs.spectrum)
    s = result.spectrum
    plt.plot(s.spectral_axis, s.flux[0,0,:], 'x')
    plt.plot(s.spectral_axis, result.fit[:,0,0])
    plt.show()

(3) Save the results to file. The output summarizes the results from the
    ``Decomposer`` class to allow users assessing the quality of the fit
    and store the derived PAH properties for later retrieval. The
    ``Decomposer`` class uses ``astropy.fits`` to write FITS-files. The
    class will attempt to incorporate relevant information when a (FITS)
    header is provided. Below is example code demonstrating the use of the
    class, which extends the previous code-block. The output from the
    code-block is shown in the flowchart.

.. code-block:: python

    result.save_pdf('NGC7023_pypahdb.pdf')
    result.save_fits('NGC7023_pypahdb.fits', header=obs.header)

Supported data formats
-----------------------

Pypahdb supports reading in IPAC tables, *Spitzer* FITS files, and *JWST* FITS
files. Support for reading pahfit\ [#]_-files is underway. Pahfit is being
developed as part of the same *JWST* ERS Program\ [#]_ as pypahdb.
