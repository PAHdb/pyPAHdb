pyPAHdb Manual
=======================

The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database [#f1]_ (PAHdb hereafter)
hosts the world's foremost collection of infrared (IR) PAH
spectra. PAHdb's spectral libraries contain over 3,000 laboratory
measured and quantum chemically computed PAH spectra. Beyond
spectroscopic data, PAHdb also provides software tools to work with
the spectral data. The portal to the data and tools is the PAHdb
website, which is located at `https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb
<https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb>`_.

The pyPAHdb Python package is being developed as part of the awarded
`James Webb Space Telescope <https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/>`_ (*JWST*)
Early Release Science (ERS) program "Radiative Feedback from Massive
Stars as Traced by Multiband Imaging and Spectroscopic Mosaics"
(`program website <http://jwst-ism.org/>`_; ID: 1288). The program is
coordinated by an international "Core team" of 19 scientists and
supported by 119 "science collaborators". pypahdb is developed by the
`NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database
<https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/>`_ team, asscociated with the
`Astrophysics & Astrochemistry Laboratory
<https://www.astrochemistry.org>`_ at `NASA Ames Research Center
<https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames>`_.

.. [#f1] Since FY2019 the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is
         being supported through a directed Work Package at NASA Ames
         titled: "Laboratory Astrophysics â€” The NASA Ames PAH IR
         Spectroscopic Database."
