# pypahdb

pypahdb is a Python package to fit and decompose astronomical PAH
emission spectra into contributing PAH subclasses.

A paper describing pypahdb in detail was presented at
[SciPy2018](https://scipy2018.scipy.org) and can be found using the
doi
[10.25080/Majora-4af1f417-00f](http://doi.org/10.25080/Majora-4af1f417-00f).

## Requirements

This software requires:

``python``
``scipy``
``astropy``

## Installation

pypahdb can be directly installed from the
[repository](https://github.com/pahdb/pypahdb) using pip:

``pip install git+git://github.com/pahdb/pypahdb.git#egg=pypahdb``

## Examples

```python
# import the pypahdb package
import pypahdb
# read-in observation.fits
observation = pypahdb.observation('observation.fits')
# run the decomposer on the spectrum in observation.fits
result = pypahdb.decomposer(observation.spectrum)
# write decomposer results to file
pypahdb.writer(result)
```
More examples can be found in the
[examples](examples)-directory.

## Unit tests

Unit-tests are available in the
[pypahdb/tests](pypahdb/tests)-directory.

## Documentation

[docs](docs)-directory.

## Background

The pypahdb package is being developed as part of the awarded [James
Webb Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) (*JWST*) Early
Release Science (ERS) program "Radiative Feedback from Massive Stars
as Traced by Multiband Imaging and Spectroscopic Mosaics" ([program
website](http://jwst-ism.org/); ID: 1288). The program is coordinated
by an international "Core team" of 19 scientists and supported by 119
"science collaborators". pypahdb is developed by the [NASA Ames PAH IR
Spectroscopic Database](http://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/) team,
asscociated with the [Astrophysics & Astrochemistry
Laboratory](http://www.astrochemistry.org) at [NASA Ames Research
Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames).

pypahdb uses a precomputed matrix of theoretically calculated PAH
emission spectra from version 3.00 of the library of computed
spectra. This matrix has been constructed from a collection of
"astronomical" PAHs, which meet the following critera and include the
fullerenes C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub>:

       'magnesium=0 oxygen=0 iron=0 silicium=0 chx=0 ch2=0 c>20 hydrogen>0'

The PAH emission spectra have been calculated with the following
parameters:

* A calculated vibrational temperature upon the absorption of a 7 eV
  photon
* A calculated integrated band intensity after following the entire emission cascade
* A redshift of 15 /cm to mimic some anharmonic effect
* A Gaussian emission profile with a FWHM of 15 /cm

Spectroscopic Database website, which is located at
