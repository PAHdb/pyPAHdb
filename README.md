# pypahdb

pypahdb is a Python package to fit and decompose astronomical PAH
emission spectra into contributing PAH subclasses, i.e., charge and
size.

A paper describing pypahdb was presented at
[SciPy2018](https://scipy2018.scipy.org) and can be found using
[https://doi.org/10.25080/Majora-4af1f417-00f](https://doi.org/10.25080/Majora-4af1f417-00f).

## Requirements

This software requires:

``python3``
``specutils``
``scipy``
``astropy``

## Installation

pypahdb can be directly installed from the
[repository](https://github.com/PAHdb/pyPAHdb) using pip:

``pip install git+git://github.com/PAHdb/pyPAHdb.git``

## Examples

```python
# import the pypahdb package
import pypahdb
# read-in a fits-file containing an astronomical observation
observation = pypahdb.Observation('/path/to/observation.fits')
# run the decomposer on the spectral data in observation.fits
result = pypahdb.Decomposer(observation.spectrum)
# Save result to fits-file
result.save_fits("/path/to/myresult.fits", header=observation.header)
```
More examples can be found in the
[examples](examples)-directory.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found at
[www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/pypahdb](https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/pypahdb).

Briefly, the methodology of pyPAHdb can be summarized in the following flowchart, consisting of three steps:
(1) Astronomical spectroscopic data is loaded, whether loaded rom FITS or ASCII files. (2) An over-sampled pre-computed matrix of PAH spectra is loaded and interpolated onto the wavelength grid of the astronomical observations. Database-fitting is performed using non-negative least-squares (NNLS), which yields the contribution of an individual PAH molecule to the total fit. As a result, we obtain a breakdown of the model fit in terms of PAH charge and size. (3) The results are written to disk as a single FITS file and as a PDF summarizing the results (one page per pixel, if a spectral cube is provided as input)

## Background

The pypahdb Python package is being developed as part of the awarded
[James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) (*JWST*)
Early Release Science (ERS) program "Radiative Feedback from Massive
Stars as Traced by Multiband Imaging and Spectroscopic Mosaics"
([program website](http://jwst-ism.org/); ID: 1288). The program is
coordinated by an international "Core team" of 19 scientists and
supported by 119 "science collaborators". pypahdb is developed by the
[NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic
Database](https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/) team, asscociated
with the [Astrophysics & Astrochemistry
Laboratory](https://www.astrochemistry.org) at [NASA Ames Research
Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames).

The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database and pypahdb are being
supported through a directed Work Package at NASA Ames titled:
*"Laboratory Astrophysics â€“ The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic
Database"*.

pypahdb uses a precomputed matrix of theoretically calculated PAH
emission spectra from version 3.00 of the library of computed
spectra. This matrix has been constructed from a collection of
*"astronomical"* PAHs, which meet the following critera and include
the fullerenes C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub>:

       'magnesium=0 oxygen=0 iron=0 silicium=0 chx=0 ch2=0 c>20 hydrogen>0'

The PAH emission spectra have been calculated employing a PAH emission
model using the following parameters:

* A calculated vibrational temperature upon the absorption of a 7 eV
  photon
* A calculated integrated band intensity after following the entire
  emission cascade
* A redshift of 15 /cm to mimic *some* anharmonic effect
* A Gaussian emission profile with a FWHM of 15 /cm

Spectroscopic Database website, which is located at
