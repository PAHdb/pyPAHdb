# pyPAHdb

pyPAHdb is a Python package to fit and decompose isolated astronomical PAH
emission spectra into contributing PAH subclasses, i.e., charge and size.

A paper describing pyPAHdb was presented at
[SciPy2018](https://scipy2018.scipy.org) and can be found using its DOI:
[https://doi.org/10.25080/Majora-4af1f417-00f](https://doi.org/10.25080/Majora-4af1f417-00f).

## Features

pyPAHdb is the light version of a full suite of [Python software
tools](https://github.com/PAHdb/AmesPAHdbPythonSuite), which has a counterpart
written in [IDL](https://github.com/PAHdb/AmesPAHdbIDLSuite). A feature
comparison is presented in the table below.

[1] FWHM: full-width at half-maximum for an emission profile.\
[2] NNLS: non-negative least squares.\
[3] In this context, refers to handling observational spectroscopic
uncertainties.

## Requirements

This software requires:

`python3` `specutils` `scipy` `astropy`

## Installation

pyPAHdb can be directly installed from the
[repository](https://github.com/PAHdb/pyPAHdb) using pip:

`pip install git+git://github.com/PAHdb/pyPAHdb.git`

## Supported data formats

pyPAHdb supports reading IPAC tables, _Spitzer_ FITS files and _JWST_ FITS files.

## Examples

```python
from pyPAHdb.decomposer import Decomposer
from pyPAHdb.observation import Observation

# read-in a file containing an astronomical observation
observation = Observation('/path/to/observation.ext')
# run the decomposer on the spectral data in observation.fits
result = Decomposer(observation.spectrum)
# display results
result.plot_fit().show()
# Save result to fits-file
result.save_fits('/path/to/myresult.fits', header=observation.header)
# Save a PDF summary of the fit results
result.save_pdf('/path/to/figure.pdf')
```

More examples can be found in the [examples](examples)-directory.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found at
[https://pahdb.github.io/pyPAHdb/](https://pahdb.github.io/pyPAHdb/).

Briefly, the methodology of pyPAHdb can be summarized in the following
flowchart, consisting of three steps: (1) Astronomical spectroscopic data is
loaded, whether loaded from FITS or ASCII files. (2) An over-sampled
pre-computed matrix of PAH spectra is loaded and interpolated onto the
wavelength grid of the astronomical observations. Database-fitting is performed
using non-negative least-squares (NNLS), which yields the contribution of an
individual PAH molecule to the total fit. As a result, we obtain a breakdown of
the model fit in terms of PAH charge and size. (3) The results are written to
disk as a single FITS file and as a PDF summarizing the results (one page per
pixel, if a spectral cube is provided as input)

## Background

The pyPAHdb Python package is being developed as part of the awarded [James Webb
Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) (_JWST_) Early Release Science
(ERS) program "Radiative Feedback from Massive Stars as Traced by Multiband
Imaging and Spectroscopic Mosaics" ([program website](http://pdrs4all.org/); ID:
1288). The program is coordinated by an international "Core team" of 19
scientists and supported by 119 "science collaborators". pyPAHdb is developed by
the [NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic
Database](https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/) team, associated with the
[Astrophysics & Astrochemistry Laboratory](https://www.astrochemistry.org) at
[NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames).

The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database and pyPAHdb are being supported
through a directed Work Package at NASA Ames titled: _"Laboratory Astrophysics -
The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database"_.

pyPAHdb uses a precomputed matrix of theoretically calculated PAH emission
spectra from version 3.00 of the library of computed spectra. This matrix has
been constructed from a collection of _"astronomical"_ PAHs, which meet the
following criteria and include the fullerenes C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub>:

```IDL
magnesium=0 oxygen=0 iron=0 silicium=0 chx=0 ch2=0 c>20 hydrogen>0'
```

The PAH emission spectra have been calculated employing a PAH emission model
using the following parameters:

- A calculated vibrational temperature upon the absorption of a 7 eV photon
- A calculated integrated band intensity after following the entire emission
  cascade
- A redshift of 15 /cm to mimic _some_ anharmonic effect
- A Gaussian emission profile with a FWHM of 15 cm<sup>-1</sup>

Database website, which is located at
